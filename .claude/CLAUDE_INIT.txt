 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /init is analyzing your codebase… 

⏺ I'll analyze the codebase and create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file. Let
  me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding the
  project.

     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when
     working with code in this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     TEL3SIS is a real-time, voice-first, agentic platform built on
     vocode-python that handles incoming phone calls with natural
     LLM-powered conversations. The system includes external tool
     integrations (Google Calendar, Weather, SMS, Email), call recording &
     transcription, human handoff capabilities, and comprehensive
     monitoring.

⏺ I have successfully analyzed the TEL3SIS codebase and created a
  comprehensive CLAUDE.md file. The analysis covered:

  Key Findings

  Project Architecture: TEL3SIS is a sophisticated voice-first AI platform
  built on FastAPI and vocode-python, featuring:
  - Real-time telephony with Twilio integration
  - Multi-agent conversational system with tool integration
  - Comprehensive monitoring and observability stack
  - Advanced security and safety measures

  Development Commands Identified:
  - Testing: pytest -q, pytest --cov, integration tests
  - Linting: pre-commit run --all-files, black ., ruff check --fix .
  - Deployment: docker compose up --build, uvicorn server.app:create_app 
  --factory
  - CLI tools: tel3sis with subcommands for dev-call, backup, manage
  operations
  - Admin UI: React frontend with npm run dev/npm run build

  Configuration Management: Centralized through Pydantic Settings with
  environment variables, including encryption keys, API credentials, and
  service URLs.

  The CLAUDE.md file provides:
  - High-level architecture overview focusing on multi-service design
  - Comprehensive development workflow commands
  - Security patterns and authentication flows
  - Testing strategies including mocked external services
  - Database operations and migration procedures
  - Monitoring and troubleshooting guidance
  - Agent collaboration system details
  - Production deployment considerations

  The file follows the requested format and focuses on the "big picture"
  architecture that requires understanding multiple components, while
  providing practical guidance for future Claude Code instances working in
  this repository.
