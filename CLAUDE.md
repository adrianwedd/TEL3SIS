## üåü Project Overview: The TEL3SIS Vision

**TEL3SIS** is a real-time, voice-first, agentic platform built on `vocode-python`. It's engineered to seamlessly answer incoming phone calls, engage in natural LLM-powered conversations, leverage external tools, record & transcribe audio, and facilitate human handoffs. Our system is designed for robustness, scalability, and intelligent interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Architecture Components: The TEL3SIS Blueprint

Understanding our core components is crucial for effective code interaction. Each piece plays a vital role in the symphony of our system.

### Core Services
- **FastAPI Server** (`server/app.py`): The high-performance backbone handling Twilio webhooks, API endpoints, and real-time communication.
- **Celery Workers**: Our asynchronous task masters, diligently processing background operations like transcription, notifications, and cleanup.
- **Redis**: The lightning-fast memory for session state management, real-time data caching, and Celery message brokering.
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Our reliable long-term memory, storing call history, user preferences, and critical application data.
- **ChromaDB**: The semantic powerhouse, enabling vector embeddings for intelligent memory retrieval and long-term conversational context.

### Agent System
- **Core Agent** (`agents/core_agent.py`): The brain of our conversational AI, orchestrating interactions and managing dialogue flow.
- **Tool Integration**: Our dynamic gateway to external capabilities, allowing the agent to intelligently select and execute tools based on user intent.
- **State Machine** (`agents/dialog_state_machine.py`): The meticulous conductor of multi-turn conversations, ensuring coherent and context-aware dialogue flow.
- **Safety Oracle** (`agents/safety_oracle.py`): Our vigilant guardian, performing pre-execution risk checks on LLM responses to ensure safe and ethical interactions (see Issue #442, #437).

### Tools & Integrations
Our agent's capabilities are extended through a rich suite of external integrations:
- **Calendar** (`tools/calendar.py`): Seamless Google Calendar integration with OAuth2 for scheduling and managing events (see Issue #433).
- **Weather** (`tools/weather.py`): Provides real-time weather information via OpenWeatherMap API (see Issue #459).
- **Notifications** (`tools/notifications.py`): Enables SMS and email communication via Twilio/SendGrid.
- **Translation** (`tools/translation.py`): Facilitates multi-language support for diverse user interactions (see Issue #355).
- **Sentiment Analysis** (`tools/sentiment.py`): Analyzes and scores call sentiment for deeper insights (see Issue #370).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management: The Heart of Adaptability

Our configuration is centralized and robust, managed through `server.settings.Settings` (a Pydantic BaseSettings model). This ensures type safety and clear definition of all configurable parameters.

-   Environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file.
-   Critical variables (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `BASE_URL`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`) are strictly enforced; the application will fail fast if they are missing.
-   Refer to `CONFIGURATION.md` for a complete and up-to-date reference of all configuration options.

## üí° Important Development Patterns: Our Engineering Philosophy

These patterns define how we build and maintain TEL3SIS, ensuring resilience, security, and maintainability.

### Error Handling: Building for Resilience
-   External API calls are meticulously wrapped in `try/except` blocks with specific exception types.
-   User-friendly fallback messages are provided for tool failures, enhancing the user experience.
-   Structured logging with rich context (e.g., `call_id`) is implemented for efficient debugging and operational insights.

### State Management: Orchestrating Data Flow
-   **Redis** is utilized for short-term session state, managing real-time call context and user actions.
-   **PostgreSQL/SQLite** serves as our mid-term memory, storing call history, user preferences, and other persistent data.
-   **ChromaDB** powers our long-term semantic memory, enabling intelligent retrieval from conversation summaries and factual knowledge bases.

### Security Considerations: Our Unwavering Commitment
Security is paramount in TEL3SIS. We embed security best practices at every layer:
-   OAuth tokens are encrypted using AES-GCM before storage, protecting sensitive user credentials.
-   All secrets are loaded exclusively from environment variables, never hardcoded or committed to the repository.
-   The Safety Oracle actively filters potentially harmful LLM outputs, acting as a critical safeguard.
-   Rate limiting is applied to API endpoints and call ingress to protect against abuse and ensure service availability.

### Testing Strategy: Our Quality Assurance Blueprint
Our testing strategy is comprehensive, ensuring reliability and correctness:
-   `USE_FAKE_SERVICES=true` enables efficient offline testing by mocking external services.
-   Vocode components are meticulously mocked in `tests/utils/vocode_mocks.py` for isolated testing.
-   Integration tests simulate full end-to-end call flows, validating system behavior across components.
-   Property-based testing is employed to uncover edge cases and unexpected behaviors.
