  # GROOMER's Open Task Analysis & Prioritization

  Current State:
  Following extensive deduplication and initial review, 30 open issues remain. Many have clarifying comments added during the grooming process.

  Prioritization Framework (from GROOMER.md):

   1. Critical bugs and regressions
   2. Incomplete or fake resolutions
   3. Verify closed issues against source code
   4. Detect semantic drift
   5. Normalize labels, deduplicate, resolve conflicts
   6. Add clarifying or resolving comments
   7. Close stale issues, merge duplicates

  Next Steps for Grooming:

  Based on this analysis, the immediate focus should remain on:

   1. Critical Security Issues: #442 (Safety Oracle function) and #437 (SafetyOracle bot) are paramount.
   2. Core Agent Functionality: #454 (self-reflection), #453 (transcription), #439 (CoordinatorAgent skeleton), and #436 (escalation triggers) are key to the system's core.
   3. Foundational UI/API: #445 (RBAC) and #438 (Backend API for Admin UI) are critical for the admin interface.
   4. Data Integrity: #463 (Database Backup/Restore) is essential for operational resilience.

  I recommend addressing these high-priority items first, then systematically working through the remaining categories.
