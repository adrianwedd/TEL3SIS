# Part 5 – Drift Analysis & Decision Audit Report

This report captures the system state as observed during a routine audit. It outlines areas of drift, summarizes key decisions, and projects possible futures for TEL3SIS.

## Drift Analysis Report

- **Feature Scope vs Tasks** – Nearly all tasks in `tasks.yml` are marked done. Documentation tasks `DOCS-01` and `DOCS-02` remain `in_review`, indicating a lag in user-facing docs.
- **Configuration Documentation** – Environment variables listed in `README.md` match `CONFIGURATION.md` and the settings modules.
- **Process vs Implementation** – CONTRIBUTING instructions align with CI workflows; pre‑commit and security scans are enforced.
- **Architecture Reviews & Proposed Tasks** – Design review tasks are reflected as completed in `tasks.yml`.
- **Residual Flask References** – Legacy Flask code has been removed as required by `REF-01`.

## Decision Audit Ledger

| Decision | Origin | Justified by | Breaks Down If |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Move to unified `Config` dataclass for env vars | Tasks `CONF-02`, README instructions | Prevent scattered `os.environ` usage and enforce validation | Startup fails if env vars are missing |
| Add `USE_FAKE_SERVICES` flag | Feature commit and docs update | Allows tests to run offline | Could mask real integration issues if used in production |
| Adopt pip-tools for dependencies | Review task `DEV-02` | Lock runtime vs dev requirements | Pip-compile not updated breaks builds |
| Implement Safety Oracle pre-execution filter | Task `SAFE-01` | Prevent unsafe LLM output | Overly strict filter blocks valid responses |
| Replace Flask with FastAPI | Task `REF-01` | Consolidate server framework | Legacy code left could cause routing conflicts |

## Trajectory Assessment

1. **Convergent Stability** – Remaining docs tasks close and CI continues to enforce quality.
2. **Process Stall** – If documentation lags or tasks accumulate without updates, drift grows.
3. **Scope Creep & Entropy** – New features outside `tasks.yml` risk structural confusion.

## Schema & Structural Integrity Checks

- `tasks.yml` follows its JSON schema.
- Directory layout and imports match documentation.
- `mkdocs.yml` indexes documentation pages coherently.

## Recommendations for Realignment

1. Finalize outstanding documentation tasks.
2. Ensure tests run consistently in CI using `USE_FAKE_SERVICES` or document setup.
3. Keep new features synchronized with `tasks.yml` and docs.

## Narrative Intelligence Score

7/10 – The repository tells a coherent story, though incomplete docs weaken the narrative.

## Agentic Harmony Score

8/10 – Roles and processes are defined, but unfinished tasks and occasional test issues reduce the score.
